# Extended-System-Programming-Laboratory

The labs focous on low-level system programming principles. They are
based on interaction with the LINUX operating system, mostly using C.
Issues covered in the labs are:
1. Processes, memory models, and interaction with the operating system.
2. A programmer’s introduction to C: storage types, pointers, structures.
3. The raw machine: basics of (x86) assembly language, linking to functions
written in C.
4. Direct system calls: a programmer’s interface with system services.
5. User’s view of the Linux file system, processes, and access permissions.
6. Command interpreters: Unix “shell”.
7. “Binary” files: formats, manipulation.
8. The ELF format, linking and loading
