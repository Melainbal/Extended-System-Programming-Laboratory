Implementing a simple shell (command-line interpreter). Like traditional UNIX shells, the shell program will also be a user level process (just like all your programs to-date),
that will rely heavily on the operating system's services. The shell supports the following:

1.Receive commands from the user.

2.Interpret the commands, and use the operating system to help starting up programs and processes requested by the user.

3.Manage process execution (e.g. run processes in the background, suspend them, etc.), using the operating system's services.
